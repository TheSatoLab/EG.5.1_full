# EG.5.1_full
This repository contains the mutation cluster and viral count matrices for modeling the relationship between amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and viral fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in the XBB lineage.\
The supplemental tables for the GISAID PI_SET_231018pe, EPI_SET_231003ue, and EPI_SET_231003vx datasets are also deposited.\
These data are used in the following study.

Tsujino et al. 2023. Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron EG.5.1 variant. bioRxiv. doi: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563209

The EPI_SET_231018pe dataset includes 5,039 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 used in calculating the mutation frequency of each XBB subvariant of interest.\
The EPI_SET_231003ue dataset includes 4,906 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 used in the phylogenetic tree reconstruction in the initial submission.\
The EPI_SET_231003vx dataset includes 157,397 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the XBB lineage circulated in the USA from December 1, 2022 to September 15, 2023 that were used in modeling the relationship between amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and viral fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in the XBB lineage.
