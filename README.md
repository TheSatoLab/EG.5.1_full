A supplemental table for the GISAID EPI_SET_231003qa, EPI_SET_231003ue, and EPI_SET_231003vx datasets is also deposited.

The EPI_SET_231003xz dataset includes 468,083 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the XBB lineage used in downstream analyses.

The EPI_SET_231017bq dataset includes 3,539 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 used in calculating the mutation frequency of each XBB subvariant.

The EPI_SET_231003ue dataset includes 4,906 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 used in the reconstruction of an XBB phylogenetic tree in the initial submission.

The EPI_SET_231003vx dataset includes 157,397 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the XBB lineage circulated in the USA from December 1, 2022 to September 15, 2023 that were used in modeling the relationship between amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and viral fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in the XBB lineage.
